# Air-Canvas-Computer-Vision
->
Air Canvas, involves a person writing/drawing in air preferably by the tip of the finiger which in turn is recognized by the device's camera (preferably front) and gets written/drawn or the device's screen. It focuses on motion-to-text conversion that can potentially serve as a software for the devices. It uses Computer Vision to trace the path of the finger. All the buttons are air detected. The aim is to track the target first, and then its motion and be able to replicate its path on the screen. Also, additional features such as color change, size change and on-screen buttons are used. The coordinates of the user's pointer finger are mapped to the screen. Using an effective dlata structure, coordinates are held and changed according to preferences of color, clear and font. Also, this can be used as a backup for the touch laptops whose touch is not working/screen is damaged. From this we hope to build an effective teaching system filled with lots of fun and joy.

Make your very own Air Canvas for doodling, drawing and everything else . In air canvas you can draw on the screen with only waiving your finger around in the air. Its actually a color tracking project with a colored on my Finger. Air Canvas is done using Python, OpenCV and Numphy.

Copy paste the code or just clone the repository and run the code.
